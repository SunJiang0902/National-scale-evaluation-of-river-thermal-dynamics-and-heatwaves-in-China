This repository contains the code used in the article “National-scale evaluation of river thermal dynamics and heatwaves in China”.
It includes:

Air2stream autorun module – automated workflow for river water temperature modeling.

RHWs model – analysis of riverine heatwaves, adapted from the marineheatwaves package.

HTEs module – calculation of high-temperature extremes in the atmosphere.

Contribution analysis file – attribution analysis based on Random Forest and regression models.

Trend module – trend detection and evaluation, including Mann–Kendall and Theil–Sen methods.
